        In this post, we explore the basics of cloud-native architecture, including its core components like containers, microservices, and orchestration. Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model.
      </p>
      <h3>Core Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Containers:</strong> Containers allow you to package your application along with its dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Microservices:</strong> This architectural style structures an application as a collection of small services.</li>
        <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Tools like Kubernetes manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By adopting a cloud-native architecture, organizations can achieve faster development, greater scalability, and improved resilience.
